Using PCL types:
    - contrasitive loss learning extension
    - Multiple heads (each PCL type)
Using strength of PCL (0-4)
    Penalising based on strength of PCL (0-4)
        - may be bad idea since level 4 is easiest, & F1 depdens on birderline cases
        - maybe introduce this early in training, but then weight other way later in training
        - or weight subtle PCL the highest - annotation noise + instability on borderline boundary
    Multiple heads:
    	- Head A: binary
        - Head B: predict severity (2/3/4 scaled)
    Focal loss 
Prompt based isntruction tuning
Using better encoder than the baseline
Data augmentation?
Fine tuning

Combination (using DeBerta)
L = BCE(binary) + λ * BCE(multilabel) + μ * Focal(binary)
